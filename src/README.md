> Verse is a new programming language from Epic Games for Unreal Engine for Fortnite (UEFN). This document aims to aid in the learning of the Verse programming language.

## Why this book?

There are a lot of people that are new to programming joining in on the fun that is [UEFN]({{ book.external.links.uefn }}). With UEFN comes a lot of new and powerful tools to create experiences to share with other players inside of Fortnite. One of those new powerful tools is Verse, Epic Games' own programming language used with UEFN to power your personalized [â€‹Devices]({{ book.external.links.uefn_glossary.device }}) specifically suited to fit your creative needs.

This guide aims to aid those wanting to either learn Verse from scratch or deepen their existing knowledge. This is an open sourced, community driven, living document, which means that it will be updated as time goes on to include more examples, correct erratum, etc. provided by both the maintainer as well as members of the community, like you!

Epic Games has a wealth of information on their [UEFN Documentation]({{ book.external.links.uefn_docs }}) site. If you haven't already, It is **highly recommended** that you read through the [Learn Programming with Verse]({{ book.external.links.uefn_verse.learn }}) sections to get a primer on the language and become more familiar with it. It also contains examples of some basic Verse examples of [gameplay mechanics][UEFN_DOCS_GAME_MECHANICS] that you could build within your own experiences. While their examples show what Verse is capable of, this document's goal is to not only demonstrate how you can use Verse on its own, but in tandem with other powerful Fortnite Devices.
