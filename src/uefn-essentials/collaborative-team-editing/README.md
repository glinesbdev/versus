# Collaborative Team Editing

When you want to create with a team of creators where multiple people are using UEFN for the same project, you will need to create a team. To create a team, go to the [Fortnite Creator Portal]({{ book.external.links.fortnite_create }}) and sign in. Once you've signed in, you can create a new team and add teammates to that team. You can also add more creators to existing teams as well.

> *ALL* creators must be *18+ years old* to be in a team and create experiences using UEFN.

> Visit Epic's [Creating Teams in Creator Portal]({{ book.external.links.fortnite_creative_team_docs }}) documentation to learn more about team projects.

Refer to our [Testing Multiplayer Projects]({{ book.uefn_essentials.path }}/testing-multiplayer-projects/README.md) article for the base multiplayer testing setup.

## Using Multiple UEFN Clients

Once you have created your team and invited your teammates, you will have to create a new experience under that team. It doesn't look to be possible to migrate existing projects to a team.

> Be sure to use the [Unreal Revision Control System]({{ book.external.links.uefn_unreal.revision_control }}) to be able to share the project's state with teammates!

Once you have the project open in UEFN, have a *single* teammate (doesn't matter who) start the session as normal via the `Launch Session` button in the toolbar. Once they are connected to the session *and* in the playtest map with their character, then the other teammates can also click the `Launch Session` button and that will bring their character into the playtest map as well as allow them to modify the map with their UEFN client and show up in the playtest map.

Epic Games' [Collaborating in Unreal Editor for Fortnite]({{ book.external.links.uefn_collaboration }}) documentation describes well the process for collaborating with a team so be sure to check that out as well!
